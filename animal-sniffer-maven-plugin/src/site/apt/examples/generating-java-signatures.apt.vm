Generating signatures of the Java Runtime

* Basic

  To generate signatures of any API, you simple construct a project with the appropriate
  dependencies exposed by the API and then add an execution of the <<<animal-sniffer:build>>>
  mojo to your project.  In the case of the Java Runtime, this is a project with no 
  dependencies, e.g.

---
<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>____</groupId>
  <artifactId>____</artifactId>
  <version>____</version>
  <packaging>pom</packaging>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>___id of execution___</id>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>build</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
---

  Then you just build this project with the appropriate Java Runtime, and it will generate the signatures of that 
  Java Runtime.

  The observant reader may have spotted that it may not always be possible to run Maven with the Java Runtime
  that you want to generate the signatures of.  In these cases you have a number of solutions:

    * Use Maven Toolchains support and the <<<jdk>>> parameter to define what toolchain you require.
      This will use automatic boot classpath detection, which does not work for Java 1.1 or earlier and
      may not work on some exotic Java Runtimes. 

      An example of using the <<<jdk>>> parameter is:

---
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        ...
        <configuration>
          ...
          <jdk>
            <version>[1.6.0,1.6.1)</version>
            <vendor>sun</vendor>
          </jdk>
          ...
        </configuration>
        ...
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
---

    * Use the <<<javaHome>>> parameter to specify the Java Home that you want to generate the signatures of.
      This will use automatic boot classpath detection, which does not work for Java 1.1 or earlier and
      may not work on some exotic Java Runtimes. 

      An example of using the <<<javaHome>>> parameter is:

---
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        ...
        <configuration>
          ...
          <javaHome>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk_1.6.0_14</javaHome>
          ...
        </configuration>
        ...
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
---

    * Use the <<<javaHomeClassPath>>> parameter to specify the exact classpath to generate the signatures of
      This is the only way to specify the Java Runtime when automatic boot classpath detection fails.
      
      An example of this technique is:

---
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        ...
        <configuration>
          ...
          <javaHomeClassPath>
            <javaHomeClassPath>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk_1.6.0_14\jre\lib\rt.jar</javaHomeClassPath>
            <javaHomeClassPath>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk_1.6.0_14\jre\lib\jsse.jar</javaHomeClassPath>
          </javaHomeClassPath>
          ...
        </configuration>
        ...
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>

* Generating "pure" signatures

  The above examples generate signatures of the entire classpath of the JRE.
  That will include all the implementation classes which are not part of the
  public contract of the JRE.  For example sun.misc.BASE64Encoder is part
  of Sun's JRE runtime libraries, but is not part of the JRE specification
  and if you run on a JRE produced by a different vendor, it is highly likely
  that that class will not be available to your program.

  In order to ensure that the Java signatures you generate only include those
  classes which are officially published by the JRE, you will need to tune
  your signatures.

** Inclusion based tuning

  One technique is to only include those classes which you know are part of the 
  JRE public specification.  For example:

---
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        ...
        <configuration>
          ...
          <jdk>
            <version>[1.4.0,1.5.0)</version>
          </jdk>
          <includeClasses>
            <includeClass>java.*</includeClass>
            <includeClass>javax.*</includeClass>
            <includeClass>org.omg.*</includeClass>
            <includeClass>org.w3c.dom.*</includeClass>
            <!-- etc -->
            ...
          </includeClasses>
          ...
        </configuration>
        ...
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
---

  This requires that you known exactly what classes are part of the JRE 
  specification.

** Exclusion based tuning

  The other technique is to specify which classes are not to be included
  (Note that a combination of the two can also be used.) For example:

---
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        ...
        <configuration>
          ...
          <jdk>
            <version>[1.4.0,1.5.0)</version>
          </jdk>
          <excludeClasses>
            <excludeClass>com.sun.*</excludeClass>
            <excludeClass>sun.*</excludeClass>
            <!-- etc -->
            ...
          </excludeClasses>
          ...
        </configuration>
        ...
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>

* When the version of Java you require is not available

  By default, if the version of java that you require is not available,
  the animal-sniffer plugin will fail the build.  If you are generating 
  multiple signatures, this may not be exactly what you want.  For example
  you may be generating signatures for JREs on windows, linux and MacOS 
  from the same project.  This would require building the same project 
  at least three times and setting the <<<skipIfNoJavaHome>>> option to
  <<<true>>> for example

<project>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        ...
        <configuration>
          ...
          <skipIfNoJavaHome>true</skipIfNoJavaHome>
          ...
        </configuration>
        ...
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>windows</id>
            ...
            <configuration>
              ...
              <jdk>
                <version>[1.4.0,1.5.0)</version>
                <os>windows</os>
              </jdk>
              ...
            </configuration>
            ...
          </execution>
          <execution>
            <id>windows</id>
            ...
            <configuration>
              ...
              <jdk>
                <version>[1.4.0,1.5.0)</version>
                <os>linux</os>
              </jdk>
              ...
            </configuration>
            ...
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
